Introducing our innovative Proxy for Active Directory (AD) and LDAP, designed to seamlessly integrate with PlusAuth
for enhancing security in legacy applications. This advanced proxy solution acts as an intermediary between
your legacy applications and your LDAP/AD systems, allowing you to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
without altering the existing infrastructure.

Legacy applications that directly connect to LDAP/AD using LDAP clients can now benefit from an additional layer
of security. Our proxy ensures that every authentication request is routed through PlusAuth, enabling robust
MFA protocols to protect against unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

With this proxy, organizations can effortlessly upgrade their security measures, ensuring compliance with modern
authentication standards while maintaining the functionality and performance of their legacy systems. It's an
essential tool for any enterprise looking to bolster their authentication framework without the need for
extensive redevelopment of existing applications.

Experience the future of secure authentication with our Proxy for AD and LDAPâ€”where legacy meets innovation
for unparalleled security.

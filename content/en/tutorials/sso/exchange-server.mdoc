## Overview

This guide walks you through integrating Microsoft Exchange Server with PlusAuth using **WS-Federation** for authentication. You will configure a PlusAuth client, install necessary certificates, update Exchange Server settings, and set up an AD/LDAP connection.

{% alert type="warning" %}
  Exchange Server integration with PlusAuth requires **Active Directory Federation Services** to be installed in your Exchange Server.
  You can check whether if it is installed or not with following command in a PowerShell session:

  ```powershell
  Get-WindowsFeature ADFS-Federation
  ```

  If it is installed you will see something like this:
  ```powershell
  Display Name                                    Name                   Install State
  ------------                                    ----                   -------------
  [X] Active Directory Federation Services        ADFS-Federation            Installed
  ```
{% /alert %}

## 1. Create a PlusAuth Client

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Clients** in your PlusAuth console.
2. Click the **Create** button to create a new client.
3. Select **Regular Web App** as the client type and give it an identifiable name.

4. After creating the client, go to its **Details** page and open the **Connectors** tab.
5. Select **WS-Fed** as the connector type.

Now, configure WS-Federation settings:

- **Realm**: `https://{owa-url}`
  Example: `https://mail.example.com/owa/`
- **Application Callback URL**: `https://{owa-url}`
  Example: `https://mail.example.com/owa/`

## 2. Download and Install Certificate on Exchange Server

1. After saving WS-Federation settings, click on the **Metadata** button right above the form.
2. Click **Download Certificate** and save it to your Exchange Server machine. You can also copy certificate contents and paste them in a file with `.crt` extension.
3. Copy and securely store the **Certificate Thumbprint** â€” you will need it later.

Next, install the downloaded certificate into the **Trusted People** store on the Exchange Server:

1. Open the **Run** dialog (Win + R), type `mmc`, and press Enter.
2. In the Management Console, go to **File > Add or Remove Snap-ins (Ctrl + M)**.
3. Find and add **Certificates** from the left panel.
4. In the Certificate Snap-In window:
  1. Choose **Computer account** and click **Next**.
  2. Select **Local Computer** and click **Finish**.
5. In the console tree, expand **Certificates (Local Computer) > Trusted People**.
6. Right-click **Trusted People > All Tasks > Import**.
7. Follow the Import Wizard:
  1. Choose the downloaded certificate.
  2. Click **Next** through the steps and **Finish**.
8. Close the Management Console without saving the snap-in layout.

## 3. Configure Exchange Server WS-Federation Settings

Now, configure Exchange Server to trust PlusAuth by executing the following commands in the **Exchange Management Shell**:

1. Define the accepted URLs for OWA and ECP endpoints:
  ```powershell
  $uris=@(
    "https://##Base URL##/owa/",
    "https://##Base URL##/ecp/",
    "https://##Base URL##/owa",
    "https://##Base URL##/ecp"
  )
  ```
  Replace `##Base URL##` with your actual OWA hostname.

2. Configure WS-Federation settings:

  ```powershell
  Set-OrganizationConfig -AdfsIssuer "##PlusAuth Issuer##" -AdfsAudienceUris $uris -AdfsSignCertificateThumbprint "##Cert Thumbprint##"
  ```
   Replace following values from the **Metadata** dialog in the PlusAuth client settings.

  `##PlusAuth Issuer##`: The WS-Federation Reply URL from PlusAuth.

  `##Cert Thumbprint##`: The SHA-1 thumbprint of the certificate you downloaded earlier.
3. Disable other authentication methods to force PlusAuth authentication:

  First disable for ECP (Exchange Control Panel)
  ```powershell
  Get-EcpVirtualDirectory | Set-EcpVirtualDirectory -AdfsAuthentication $true -BasicAuthentication $false -DigestAuthentication $false -FormsAuthentication $false -WindowsAuthentication $false
  ```

  And then disable for OWA (Outlook Web App)

  ```powershell
  Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -AdfsAuthentication $true -BasicAuthentication $false -DigestAuthentication $false -FormsAuthentication $false -WindowsAuthentication $false -OAuthAuthentication $false
  ```
4. Restart IIS services to apply your changes:
  ```powershell
  net stop was /y
  net start w3svc
  ```


## 4. Create AD/LDAP Connection
1. Go to `Dashboard > Connections`
2. Create a new `AD / LDAP` Enterprise connection
3. Enter name, and select the client created above.
4. Fill required fields according to your AD/LDAP connection.
5. After creating the connection, toggle **Default Connection** to make it the default for your tenant.

For more details on creating AD/LDAP connection, have a look at [AD/LDAP Connections](/concepts/authentication/identity-providers/ldap)

## 5. Test login
1. Navigate to owa login page, For example, [https://mail.example.com/owa/]
2. You should be redirected to PlusAuth's login screen.

  Being as identity and access management solution PlusAuth also uses itself for authentication.
  For using the Api you must have an access token retrieved from PlusAuth. Be aware that access tokens hold
  your privileges so make sure to keep them safe.

  PlusAuth Rest API protected by [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and you
  can access it with [Bearer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) tokens.

  API requests that made over HTTP will be redirected to corresponding HTTPS endpoint.
  Depending on your http client those redirects may fail, so make sure you use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

  You can retrieve tokens by using [OAuth 2.0 flows](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4).

  ::alert{type="info"}
  Auth Plus API expects tokens to be granted to the user himself.
  That means you cannot use `Client Credentials` flow which results in machine to machine tokens.
  ::

  ::alert{type="info"}
  Make sure you have granted the permissions to client as it described in [Core Authorization](/en/api/core/authorization#client-configuration).

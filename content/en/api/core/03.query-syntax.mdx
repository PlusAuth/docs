        <h1>PlusAuth Query Language Reference</h1>

PlusAuth provides its own [CQL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Query_Language) for querying over resources in an easy way. It will be referred as **PQL (PlusAuth Query Language)** in PlusAuth documentation.

Common features and characteristics of PQL are as following:

1. Consists one or more statements
2. Logical connector operators ( `AND`, `OR` )
3. Common operators ( `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `>`, `&gt;=`, `>=`, `IN` )
4. Supports nested properties ( `profile.name`, `metadata.color`, .etc)
5. Field grouping ( `profile[given_name = "John" AND family_name = "Doe" ]` )

Below, you can find more examples and detailed descriptions of PQL.

Common operators
----------------

You can check equality, greatness and matching value in a list of values. Here is a sample query for retrieving users whose email is verified.

    email_verified = true

For retrieving users whose email is NOT verified, you can use not equal operator

    email_verified != true

You can use greater than **\>**, less than **&lt;**, greater or equal **\>=**, less or equal **&lt;=** operators in the same way.

Match value in a list of values
-------------------------------

For checking value from a defined list of values PQL provides **IN** operator. You can provide list of values being separated by commas.

    profile.given_name IN "John","Jane"

The query above will retrieve users whose given name is either "John" or "Jane"

Logical operators
-----------------

In some cases you may need to have more than one condition to apply for retrieving your resources. You can use **AND**,**OR** for this purpose.

Let's retrieve users whose email is "johndoe@johndoe.club" or whose email is not verified. Here is the query:

    email = "johndoe@johndoe.club" OR email_verified != true

You can also group statements. Just wrap your condition with parentheses. Here is an example:

    (profile.given_name = "Jane" AND profile.family_name != "Doe") OR email_verified = true

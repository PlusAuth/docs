Every email used by PlusAuth can be tailored to match your branding and communication style. To edit a template:

1. Go to [**Dashboard > Customization > Email Templates**](https://dashboard.plusauth.com/#customization/email-templates).
2. Click on the template you want to customize.

Both **From** and **Subject** fields support dynamic templating, meaning you can use dynamic variables in these fields as well.

Every variable in our [templating guide](/concepts/customization/templates/customizing-templates#available-variables) are available.
Some templates may have additional variables.
You can see final variables in the related template's page (**Dashboard > Customization > Email Templates > \[Template]**) within the Preview Variables editor.

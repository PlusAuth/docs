PlusAuth lets you customize every view served by it. Go to [Dashboard > Customization > Views](https://dashboard.plusauth.com/#customization/pages).

There is no limitation in views, you can write any HTML/CSS/JS as long as you make the required requests to PlusAuth.
You can have a look to [Web API](/en/api/web) for the corresponding requests to each page.


{% alert %}
Functionality of previews will be limited. For example, you cannot sign in or register from the preview.
{% /alert %}

## View Context Parameters
For your business requirements you will need to access to some parameters in views such as authorization parameters,
client details, connection name, some view related settings etc. PlusAuth provides a context object for such purposes.

You can access to context object from your views by calling `PlusAuth` global object or more specifically `window.PlusAuth`.

Here is an example context object:

```json title="Example"
{
  "client": {
    "applicationType": "web",
    "clientName": "My Client Name",
    "logoUri": "https://mycdn.example/logo.png",
    "social": [
      {
        "name": "github",
        "provider": "github",
        "branding": {
          "logo_url": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,...",
          "display_name": "GitHub",
          "show_in_login": true
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "google",
        "provider": "google",
        "branding": {}
      }
    ]
  },
  "connection": {
    "name": "plusauth",
    "type": "plusauth"
  },
  "details": {},
  "params": {
    "audience": "uri:my-resource",
    "client_id": "<<CLIENT_ID>>",
    "nonce": "<<SOME_RANDOM_VALUE>>",
    "redirect_uri": "https://myapplication.example/callback",
    "response_mode": "fragment",
    "response_type": "code",
    "scope": "openid profile email scope1 scope2",
    "state": "<<SOME_RANDOM_VALUE>>"
  },
  "prompt": {
    "name": "login"
  },
  "settings": {
    "auto_sign_in": true,
    "forgot_password_enabled": true,
    "password_policy": {

    },

}
```

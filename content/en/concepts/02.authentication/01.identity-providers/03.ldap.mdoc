You can integrate your applications with your AD/LDAP server with a few keystrokes.
All you need is your AD/LDAP server's connection properties.

The flow is simple, when an AD/LDAP user authenticates successfully, the same user will be created in PlusAuth to
make sure your LDAP users and your application benefits from all of PlusAuth functionality and features. However,
every time they try to log in, the password verification will be handled by your
AD/LDAP server.

To create an AD/LDAP connection, go to [Dashboard > Connections > Enterprise Connections > AD/LDAP](https://dashboard.plusauth.com/#connections/enterprise/ldap/new).

AD/LDAP federated connection contains two sections for the configuration which are `Connection Configuration` and `User Object Mapping`.

## Connection Configuration

Like any external connection, PlusAuth must know your AD/LDAP server's connection details and credentials to interact with it.

## User Object Mapping

Companies have different structures and user profiles in their AD/LDAP servers. To ensure consistency with your application and different connection types, PlusAuth requires
you to map PlusAuth user's properties with your AD/LDAP user's attributes.


The mapping configuration is written in **JSON format**. The configuration's **keys** correspond to fields in the **PlusAuth user object**,
 and some LDAP specific configuration, such as:

- `email`
- `username`
- `blocked`
- `object_classes`
etc.

{% alert %}
The PlusAuth Dashboard offers **autocomplete functionality** to help you while configuring your connection.
{% /alert %}

### Value Types

Each key expects a value of one of the following types:

- `string`
- `boolean`
- `string[]` (array of strings)
- a **constant value object**

These values represent the **attribute name in the AD/LDAP user object**.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab-item label="Boolean" %}

  If the value is a `boolean` (`true`), the **same key** will be used to look up the corresponding attribute in the AD/LDAP user.

  ```json
  {
    "phone_number": true
  }
  ```
  This configuration will look for the `phone_number` attribute in the AD/LDAP user object.
  
  {% /tab-item %}

  {% tab-item label="String" %}
  If the value is a `string`, it specifies the exact attribute name to use in the AD/LDAP user object.

  ```json
  {
    "username": "uid"
  }
  ```
  This maps the `uid` attribute from AD/LDAP user to the `username` field in PlusAuth user.

  {% /tab-item %}

  {% tab-item label="String Array" %}
  If the value is a `string[]` (array of strings), each attribute is checked in order. The first one with a non-empty value will be used.
  ```json
  {
    "name": [
      "name",
      "cn"
    ]
  }
  ```

  This checks the `name` attribute first. If it's empty or missing, it falls back to `cn`.
  {% /tab-item %}

  {% tab-item label="Constant Value" %}
  You can assign a fixed value by using an object with a `value` field.
  ```json
  {
    "metadata.my_attr": { "value": "MY_CONSTANT_VALUE" }
  }
  ```
  This always sets `metadata.my_attr` in PlusAuth user object to `"MY_CONSTANT_VALUE"`.

  {% /tab-item %}
{% /tabs %}


{% alert %}
  You can use following command to get your AD user's all attributes. Replace `##Username##` with a valid username.
```shell
get-aduser ##Username## -Properties *
```
{% /alert %}

### Required Fields in Mapping Configuration

| **object\_classes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Existing `objectClass` attributes for your LDAP users.

| **email**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Required for reset password functionality. Most common attribute is `mail`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Other fields are optional but in some cases they may be crucial to set, otherwise some flows will not work as expected or
some AD/LDAP users would lack some functionality. For example, if you are using SMS Multi-Factor Authentication in your
application, as you would guess, a phone number is required. If your AD/LDAP users already have a phone number you
should map its attribute too.

{% alert %}
PlusAuth automatically converts `objectGUID`, `objectSid` attributes to their string representation.
`jpegPhoto` and `thumbnailPhoto` attributes are converted to [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data)'s.
Additionally, `logonHours` is parsed as following format:
```ts
// array of objects
{
    day: string
    hour: number
    allowed: boolean
}[]
```
{% /alert %}

## Password Caching
PlusAuth supports caching AD/LDAP users' passwords in its database.
This ensures availability even when your AD/LDAP instance is not reachable.

To enable this feature, set the `password` property to `true` in your AD/LDAP connection's mappings. 

Example:
```json
{
  "id": "objectGUID",
  "password": true,
  //... (other mappings)
}
```

After setting the mapping, whenever an AD/LDAP user authenticates successfully, their password will be stored in the user credentials.

PlusAuth allows you to customize brute-force attack protection according to your requirements.

Brute force attacks are simple and reliable. In this type of attack, an attacker submits many passwords or passphrases with
the hope of eventually guessing a combination correctly. The attacker systematically checks
all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. As you can guess, this process is
handled by computers. In a simple environment, thousands of passwords could be checked in a couple of seconds.

Brute-Force attack protection is enabled by default, and you can configure or disable it according to your requirements.

{% alert type="warning" %}
It is highly discouraged to disable brute-force attack protection.

To customize brute-force protection, go to [Dashboard > Security](https://dashboard.plusauth.com/#policies)
and expand the **Brute-Force Protection** section.

## Configuration

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled | Enable/Disable Brute-Force Protection |
| Send Notification | If this is enabled, your users will receive an email informing them about the login attempt from the blocked IP after all attempts are exhausted.  **Blocked IP** template will be used for this email. |
| Maximum Allowed Attempts | Maximum count for a user to consecutively fail logins for the same IP.  |
| Duration | Attempts will be counted for the specified seconds.  |
| Block Duration | How many seconds should PlusAuth block the IP for the specified user.  |
| IP WhiteList | List of IP's should be ignored from brute-force protection  |

For example, with following configuration
```shell
Send Notification = true
Maximum Attempts = 10
Duration = 3600 (1 hour in seconds)
Block Duration = 2592000(30 Days in seconds)
```
if a user fails to log in to their account consecutively 10 times *(Maximum Allowed Attempts)* in an
hour *(Duration)* from the same IP, their account will be blocked for 30 days *(Block Duration)*, and
they will receive configured **Blocked IP** email.

## Example Scenarios
Although it is advised to configure brute-force with low attempts and high durations, some would like to configure
it in a less strict way.

For example, some would like to allow trying again in short duration rather than having long block durations.

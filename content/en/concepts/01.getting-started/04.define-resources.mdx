title: Define Resources
---

The **Resource** entity represents a logical or physical asset within your system that users
or entities seek to access or interact with. Thanks to the resources, you can control access to your system down to the
smallest detail.

To create a **Resource** navigate to [Dashboard > Resources](https://dashboard.plusauth.com/#resources) and click
to **Create** button.

Resource creation requires at least a **Name** and an **Audience**.
